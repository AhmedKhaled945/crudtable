Description: Crudtable is a module for Shiny web-applications that provides full data manipulation functionality:
    Creating, Reading, Updating and Deleting. Data are viewed in a data table, which contains buttons for editing
    or deleting of a record. Data editing is done via user-definable modal dialog that supports various input types
    as well as validation of input data. Crudtable uses the DBI interface to access the data table so that
    it is easy to connect it to the database such as SQLite or to modify the in-memory data frame.
